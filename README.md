# LZTraining
Download training data from LC0

This is a console-based application for downloading training data. Upon running the program, there are three options: downloading missing files by pressing the 'C' key, verifying downloaded files by pressing the 'V' key and stopping the program by pressing the 'Esc' key.
If no arguments are provided upon running the program, then it uses the default configuration plan. If an argument is passed to the program, it is treated as a path to a JSON file containing a custom configuration plan. Upon verifying the downloaded files, there is either a message confirming the successful downloads or a summary of errors that occurred during the download. The program ends after the 'Esc' key is pressed or if there are too many arguments provided.
